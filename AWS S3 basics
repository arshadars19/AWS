* **Key Features:**
    * **Automatic Scaling:** Adjusts storage capacity based on your needs.
    * **Unlimited Data Storage:** Store as much data as you need.
    * **Secure Access:** Access your data from anywhere in the world.

**How S3 Works:**

* **Buckets:**  Data is stored in buckets, each with a unique name.
* **Permissions:** You control who can access, edit, or view data in your buckets.
* **Location:** Choose a geographical region for your bucket, which cannot be changed later.
* **Limitations:**
    * 100 buckets per AWS account.
    * Difficult to remove buckets with over 100,000 objects.

**Storage Classes:**

* **S3 Standard:** For frequently accessed data (e.g., website content, videos, photos).
* **Standard IIA:** For infrequently accessed data (e.g., backups, disaster recovery).
* **One Zone IIA:** For data that can be recreated if lost, accessed less frequently.
* **Intelligent Tiering:** Automatically moves data between tiers based on access patterns (e.g., YouTube videos).
* **Glacier Instant Retrieval:** For long-term archive data with occasional, but quick access.
* **Glacier Flexible Retrieval:** For longer-term backups with retrieval times planned for once a year.
* **Glacier Deep Archive:** For very long-term data with retrieval times of 12 hours.

**Important Features:**
